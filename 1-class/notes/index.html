## CSBC 1000 - Fundamentals of Backend and Blockchain Development

### Class 1: The three-tier architecture

*Dhruvin Parikh*

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Class Plan
* Introduction to three-tier architecture
* Overview of :
 * Frontend development
 * Backend development
 * Full stack development
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Deployment Environment

* Development
* Testing
* Staging or Pre-production or UAT (user-acceptance testing)
* Production

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## DBMS architecture

* **Single tier architecture** 
* **Two tier architecture**
* **Three tier architecture**
  * functional processes, logic, data access, data storage and UI interface done independently as separate modules
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Single tier architecture

![](./single-tier.webp)
* Client, server, and Database all reside on the same machine. 
* For e.g. installing a Database in your system and access it to practice SQL queries. 
* Rarely used in "production".

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Two tier architecture

<img src="./two-tier.webp" width="250">
* Server and database reside on same machine
* Presentation layer runs on a client (PC, Mobile, etc.) 
* Data is stored on a server called the second tier. 
* It also provides direct and faster communication.
* E.g. Contact Management system using MS-Access

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Three tier architecture

<img src="dbms_3tier.png" style="background-color: white" width="300" />

* Development and maintenance of functional processes, logic, data access, data storage, and user interface is done independently as separate modules. 
* Contains a presentation layer, an application layer, and a database server.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Goal of three tier architecture

* Segregate user applications and physical database
* Program-data independence
* Support multiple views of Data

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Layers of 3 tier architecture

* **Presentation layer**
  * HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Javascript(React JS)
* **Application layer**
  * Java, .NET, C#, Python, C++, Javascript (Node JS)
* **Database server**
  * MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, LevelDB, CouchDB

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Presentation layer

* Consists of web-based user interface displaying content useful to end user
* Web-based application mostly build with Php, HTML, JavaScript and CSS based frameworks like React, Next, Vue, Nuxt, etc
* Mobile based application mostly build with Swift, Android, React native, ionic, Xamarin, Objective C etc

</script></section>
  
  
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Application layer

* Enables communication between end-user and DBMS as well as reverse.
* The application layer(business logic layer) also processes functional logic, constraint, and rules before passing data to the user or down to the DBMS.
* Contains application's business logic to drive application's core capabilities
* Mostly build using NodeJS, Java, .NET, C#, Python, C++ etc

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
## Data layer

* Contains database/data storage system and data access layer.
* Mostly spun up using MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc
* The application layer accesses data via API calls.
* Useful for scaling the system
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Sample Data 
* Insight for e-commerce store's customer location

</pre>

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Frontend
  
  * Lies on application layer and acts as a client to backend application
  * Provides visual and interactive experience to user
  * Parses data from data layer and presents in human readable form.  
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## UI/UX design
  
* Look and feel of the application
* Tools like Adobe XD, Figma, Lucid chart, Balsamiq, Sketch etc are used for wire framing and simulation
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## wire-frames

![](./wireframe-example.webp)
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## UI/UX wire-frames

* A wireframe is generally a monochromatic drawing thatâ€™s created in the design phase of "Design Thinking Process". 
* It provides a blueprint of the page structure, layout, information and functions. 
* This in turn gives a clear idea to the stakeholders about the functioning and visual representation of application UI.
* It help save time, gathering feedback and create accurate designs
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## UI/UX design principles
  
* Avoid jargon and non-actionable data
* Be consistent and use a design system
* Use existing UX patterns
* Create active guidance and feedback
* Allow for and anticipate mistakes
* Focus on localization and device agnostic
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## UI/UX trust signalling
  
* Give explicit control to the user
* Reduce anxiety and cognitive load. 
* Guide with consistency. 
* Respect established conventions. 
* Capture and confirm potential mistakes
* Make the complex intuitive

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## UI/UX Key Takehomes
  
* Wireframes should be used early in a project to get user and client approval on the layout of key pages and the navigation.
* The user is the weakest link in the security chain
* The UI is the place to make them stronger
* Designers are the protectors
  
</script></section>

  
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Development
  
  * The wire-frames created during UI/UX design is converted into code.
  * Involves creating visual components around the screen of the device
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Client Side rendering
  
  * Initial requests load page, layout, CSS and Javascript
  * Some or all of the content isn't included
  * Instead, the JS makes anothe r request, gets a response (likely in JSON),
  and generates appropriate HTML (likely using a template library such as React)
  * For subsequent updates to the page, CSR repeats the steps it used to get initial content.
  * Demo CSR Example

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ### Server side rendering (Dynamic Rendering)
  
  * Initial requests loads the page, layout, CSS, JS and **content**
  * Blank page flicker does not happen. (developers mask this problem with a loading image using CSR)
  * SEO friendly : Search engines are able to index and crawl efficiently. Content is present before you get it.
  * Works fine with text-based sites; mostly static sites
  * HTML is generated at each request; Slow page rendering comparatively
  * Demo SSR Example

</script></section>

  ## 15 minute break
  
</script></section>

  
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Deployment/Publishing
  
  * Web application can be deployed on the hosted services on the internet
  * Mobile applications can be published to its corresponding digital distribution service.
  * Can host on platforms like GH pages, surge.sh, AWS amplify, Firebase hosting
  
</script></section>
  
  
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Backend
  
  * Decision on storing and computation of data
  * Requires robust planning as it takes important decisions.
  * Scalable, reliable and maintainable
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Three tier application architecture

  <img src="backend-architecture.jpeg" style="background-color: white; width: 800px;" />
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## System design

  * Requirement gathering
  * High level system design
  * Design core components like API, data model
  * Identify bottle necks and scale up the system
  * The non-functional requirements of todayâ€™s large scale products demand that backend systems be scalable, reliable and maintainable. 
  * Following is the list of sequence to make BE systems scalable, reliable and maintainable 
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ### Sequence 1

  * Who is this system for?
  * How will this end user get access to your service?
  * How many users do you estimate will be on this service hourly, daily, annually?
  * What do the requests to the system look like?
  * What will users expect this service to output?
  * Will system be more read heavy or write intensive?
  * How fast should search results be?
  * Should user requests be handled in real time?
  * Will web traffic always be equally distributed across all locations your service will be deployed? 
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ### Sequence 2

  <img src="system_design.png" style="background-color: white; width: 600px;" />

  * Sketch high level design of main components
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ### Sequence 3

  * Estimate the required storage and bandwidth
  * How much data would you need to store individual records? e.g say 1 Tweet = 10KB
  * How much data is this per month for your estimated number of users?
  * How many read/write requests per second are there?
  * If a popular account shares an activity, how does this impact the number of reads?
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ### Sequence 4

  * Design core components like the API, data model
  * Do your use cases point you towards a relationship data model or document-based model?
  * Will you use RPC, SOAP, REST or another API model?
  * what will the API request body/parameters contain?
  * If tasks take too long, how do you store them so that their status can be later queried by a user?
  * How will service authenticate and authorize users?
  * Will any processes in your service depend on an external service?
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ### Sequence 5

  * What portion of the code/system takes too long?
  * Can certain tasks be broken up and handled by smaller child processes?
  * Is it possible to store static files separately and closer to your users with a CDN?
  * How do you ensure that if a server or database goes down, your service wonâ€™t go down as well?
  * Is there a way to monitor and log the behavior of your service?
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Backend development
  
  * Selecting database (SQL v/s NoSQL)
  * Application configuration
  * Code Review
  * Testing - unit, integration, system, acceptance
  * Technical debt
  * **Deployment environments**
    * Development, testing, staging, production 
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Selecting database : SQL
  
  * Relation Data Model
  * Pros:
   * Easy to use and setup. 
   * Universal, compatible with many tools.
   * Good at high-performance workloads.
   * Good at structure data.
  * Cons:
   * Time consuming to understand and design the structure of the database.
   * Can be difficult to scale
  
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Selecting database : NoSQL
  
  * Document Data Model
  * Pros:  
   * No investment to design model. 
   * Rapid development cycles.
   * In general faster than SQL.
   * Runs well on the cloud.
  * Cons:
   * Not suitable for interconnected data.
   * Technology still maturing.
   * Can have slower response time.
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Application configuration
  
  * The port to run the software on
  * The authentication tokens to access other software
  * The location of keys and trusted certificates (to validate client requests)
  * The URL to access the database
  * Environment variables
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Code Review
  
  * The purpose of setting up a code review system on a team is to ensure that the agreed quality standards are met. 
  * It also ensures that existing features are not broken and new bugs are not introduced. 
  * This process is manual. 
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Technical debt
  
  * Abrupt introduction of requirements leads developers to decide between getting the task done quickly with low quality or to maintain a high quality and possibly miss the deadline. 
  * The cost of taking the easier path, which would need to be repaid in the future, is called technical debt.
  
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Deployment Environments
  
  * **Development**
   * Dev team's feature preview and collaboration
  * Testing
   * Used by project team for acceptance testing with test data
  * Staging
   * Pre-production used for final acceptance based on production size data set
